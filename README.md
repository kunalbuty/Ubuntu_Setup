# Ubuntu Setup

## Instructions
This is simply a bash file that installs some of the basic programs I use on Ubuntu.
Basically for every time I brick linux and need to restart :)

To install, simply do the following
1) Be the root user
2) run `sudo ./ubuntuSetup.sh`
3) You may occasionally have to click `enter` or `y` to confirm a download/install
4) That's it!
