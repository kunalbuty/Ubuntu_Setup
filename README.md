# Ubuntu Setup Automation

## Description
This is simply a bash file that installs some of the basic programs I use on Ubuntu. Basically for every time I brick linux and need to restart :)
I'll be trying to update this over time, so stay tuned!

## Instructions
1) Log into ubuntu as a user with root permissions.
2) Download the bash file. Comment out/remove any lines corresponding to apps/packages you don't want.
3) Run `sudo ./ubuntuSetup.sh` to begin the installation process.
4) You may occasionally have to click `enter` or `y` to confirm a download/install.
5) That's it!
